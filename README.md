### *if you've tried to contact me about Sage on the Raspberry Pi recently, I've been having some email-related difficulties, so please resend the message!* 
*FYI this repo's for bugs and docs + the [wiki](http://github.com/ArchimedesPi/SageMathematics-raspi/wiki/), not downloads or source. see below for downloads.*

A small change in here.

Downloads:
===========
  * Sage 6.0 (current): [tarball](http://goo.gl/dcpBtR)
  * Sage 5.8 (older): [tarball](http://goo.gl/gnzoDx)

*I use Goo.Gl to shorten the links so you can type them into the Pi _easily_*


=====================================================================================

This is a recompilation of Sage Mathematics for the Armv6l armhf Raspberry Pi.
If, by any chance, you want to compile it yourself, check out the [wiki](http://github.com/ArchimedesPi/SageMathematics-raspi/wiki/)!


More info about Sage is available at www.sagemath.org

On this Github repository, there is a issue tracker.
Please do not use it for Sage-related problems, as those should be opened on the [Sage trac wiki/tracker](http://trac.sagemath.org).
Instead, use it for Sage issues related to the Raspberry Pi.

The downloading and unpacking should occur on the Raspberry Pi itself.
To download:

````
  cd ~
  mkdir sage-math
  cd sage-math
  wget <goo.gl url>
````  
Goo.Gl url is either:

  * Sage 6.0 (current): http://goo.gl/dcpBtR
  * Sage 5.8 (older): http://goo.gl/gnzoDx

You should check the integrity of the tarballs. You can check the hashes by running
```bash
md5sum <filename>
```
or
```bash
md5 <filename>
```
and seeing if they match these:

* Sage 6.0 (current): `a6c931b94488d9e35df148809ceed23f`
* Sage 5.8: `b09b21311e94a31d487360e12786b953`

That lets you know the tarball isn't corrupted.
To untar the tarball:

````
  tar zxvf <tarball name>
````

If the untarring fails, try prefixing `tar` with `sudo` - that sometimes works.
If that doesn't work, *please* post an issue!

Running it is as easy as `cd`ing into the unpacked tarball and running
```bash
./sage
```
